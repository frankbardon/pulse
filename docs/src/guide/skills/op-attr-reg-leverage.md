Attributes emit row-level scalars; they do not produce `Response.Components`.

## Use when

Adds to every row its leverage: how unusual its predictor values are, and so how hard it can pull a straight-line fit.

Questions it answers:

- Which rows have predictor values so far from the rest that they could steer the model?
- Which customers have predictor values extreme enough that they could pull the fitted line (read their residuals to see whether they do)?

Use something else:

- `REG_OLS` when you want the model itself.

## Params

Top-level keys, not `params`; `field` unread.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target` | field | (required) | Dependent variable field. |
| `predictors` | list | (required) | Independent variable fields. |
| `weight` | slot weight | inherited | `null` opts out; REG_OLS kinds. Diag of W½X(XᵀWX)⁻¹XᵀW½ (R `hatvalues`); excluded row: 0. |

## Inputs

`target` / `predictors` — admitted types: see `## Contract`; `decimal128` reads as its float64 echo, `packed_bool` as 0/1.

- `Label` — required — new column name

## Output

One `float64` per record — `hᵢᵢ = 1/n + (xᵢ − μ_x)ᵀ · M2_xx⁻¹ · (xᵢ − μ_x)`. Over the rows in the fit it lies in `[1/n, 1]` and sums to `p + 1` (predictors + intercept); a row outside the fit (null target, predictors present) is scored from its predictors and can exceed 1. **Null (never 0) when any predictor is null, NaN or ±Inf**; a row the weighted refit excludes stays 0.

## Reading the output

- `value`: How far the row's predictor values sit from the other rows' (from the predictors' means, scaled by their spread and correlation), and so how hard the row can pull the fitted line toward itself: the hat-matrix diagonal 1/n + (x - mean)' M^-1 (x - mean), where M is the predictors' centred sum-of-squares-and-cross-products matrix. Over the n rows in the fit it runs from 1/n to 1 and averages p / n, where p counts the coefficients including the intercept.
  - Caveat: Unpenalized least squares only; a request with a penalty is refused.

## Contract

- Types (`target`, `predictor`): `date`, `datetime`, `decimal128`, `f32`, `f64`, `packed_bool`, `u16`, `u32`, `u4`, `u64`, `u8`; any other scalar type is `PULSE_FIELD_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED`.
- Weight: weighted under `frequency` and `probability` weights.
- Streaming: streamable.

## Gotchas

- **Unpenalized OLS only** — any non-empty `penalty` raises `PROCESSING_CONFIG`.
- High leverage flags outliers in PREDICTOR space (vs residuals, which flag the response). Rule of thumb: hᵢᵢ > 2(p+1)/n.
- Two-pass — pre-pass fits OLS, pass 2 emits per row.
